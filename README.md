 # ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Xavier! 
  I am a Computer Science graduate from FEU Instute of Technology in the Philippines and I aspire to become a Software QA Engineer. During my internship, I had the opportunity to become a tester for the web applications that our company was developing. During this time, I was able to gain skills such as Test Case creation and execution,  functional testing, bug reports creation and presentation, as well as the use of Jira for test management.<br/>
